# tricklezip
A compression library for embedded devices, which does not use up all your CPU time at once.

It is based on the DEFLATE algorithm as described in [RFC1951](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt).

You may either run the compression just trickly, or in a given time. It is meant to be a relaxed compression library, so chill!
